# Divisor harmony

The sum of divisors of 6 is 12 and the sum of divisors of 28 is 56. You will notice that 12/6 = 2 and 56/28 = 2. We shall say that (6,28) is a pair with a ratio of 2. Similarly, (30,140) is also a pair but with a ratio of 2.4. These ratios are simply decimal representations of fractions.

(6,28) and (30,140) are the only pairs in which every member of a pair is 0 <= n < 200. The sum of the lowest members of each pair is 6 + 30 = 36.

You will be given a range(a,b), and your task is to group the numbers into pairs with the same ratios. You will return the sum of the lowest member of each pair in the range.

solve(0,200) = 36
Good luck!
